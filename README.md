## scSNV

scSNV is an alternative to Cell Ranger + velocyto for the alignment, quantification and SNV calling of 10X Single Cell RNA-seq data. Currently, scSNV supports 10X 5-prime and 3-prime 10X version 2 and 3 libraries.

Example python scripts to annotate SNVs, identify barcode tags that represent cells and generate the data from the scSNV manuscript is available in the scsnvpy folder within the scsnv repository.

For reproducibility the version of Cell Ranger used in our manuscript comparisons is available at [here](https://github.com/GWW/cellranger_211_mirror)

scSNV requires the HDF5 C and C++ Libraries for compilation.

## Building instructions:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GWW/scsnv.git
cd scsnv
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```

```bash
cd scsnvpy
pip install cython numpy ncls #NCLS fails to automatically install with some python versions but works with pip
python setup.py install
```

The only executable needed to use scsnv is located in scsnv/build/src/scsnv
The scsnvmisc python executable will be installed

## Directory Setup

scSNV expects the fastq files to be generated with the Cell Ranger mkfastq command.  For example:
```
./run1/Library1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
./run1/Library1_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz
./run1/Library1_S1_L001_I1_001.fastq.gz
```
We recommend organizing your data as follows and assume this organization for the manual
```
sample/run1/<fastq_files>
```
Where sample is the name you wish to use for your sample and run1 is the name you wish to use for the folder containing your fastq files

## Example alignment and pileup for one sample

This assumes a 10X V2 3'-library using the 737K barcode set from 10X genomics.  For V3 libraries you need to use the 3M set.
This assumes you have already indexed the genome fasta file with BWA. The library type should be specified for each of the commands as:

```
10X V2 3-prime:   -l V2
10X V3 3-prime:   -l V3
10X V2 5-prime:   -l V2_5P
10X V3 5-prime:   -l V3_5P
```

The list of available barcodes must also be specified.  For v2 libraries this is the `737k-august-2016.txt` file and for v3 libraries the `3M-february-2018` file.

```bash
#Build the index, only required once
scsnv index -g genes.gtf -r genome.fa index_prefix

#Count the number of barcodes
scsnv count -o sample/barcode  -k scsnv/data/737K-august-2016.txt -l V2 sample/run1

#Map the reads, quantify gene expression, and write the sorted mRNA-tag alignments
#The -i option must be the path to the index_prefix used with scsnv_index
#The -g option should be to the genome fasta file indexex with bwa mem 
#The group file (-c option) lists genes of interest.  The find optimal number of cells command uses it to measure mitochondrial expression
#The group file is a tab delimited file with a header, for example:
#There is an example file for human ensembl 94 in the data/gene_groups.txt
#gene_id<tab>group
#ENSG00000211459<tab>MT


scsnv map -l V2 -i index_prefix -g bwa_genome_index -b sample/barcode -t 24 --bam-write 4 -q 4 -c index_prefix/gene_groups.txt -o sample/ sample/run1

#Collapse the mRNA-tags into collapsed molecules
#If you get a lot of warnings about regions with more than 50M reads, you can increase the number of reads permitted for a single gene
#region using the -r option, for example, `-r 100`
#If you run out of memory you can reduce the number of reads (-r 20), however, some genes will not be properly collapsed as a result
scsnv collapse -l V2 -r genome_fasta -i index_prefix -o sample/ --threads 4 --bam-write 8 -b sample/barcode_counts.txt.gz sample/merged.bam

#Find the optimal number of cells or use a pre-defined list of barcodes
#If a group file wasn't specified you can add the --skip-mt flag to skip MT DNA(%) calculations
#There are additional options to control how cells are filtered that can be used see scsnvmisc cells -h
#Alternatively, you can create a passed_barcodes.txt.gz file with a single field called "barcode" and one cell barcode per line

scsnvmisc cells -o sample sample/summary.h5

#Pileup the reads from the collapsed molecules using a list of passed barcodes
scsnv pileup -l V2 -i index_prefix -r genome_fasta -o sample/pileup -p ./sample/passed_barcodes.txt.gz -t 4 -x 4 ./sample/collapsed.bam

#The pileup can be annotated and bi-allelic strand-specific SNVs can be called using the scsnvpy annotate command (See Below)

#Quantify SNV co-expression and collapsed molecule lengths.  This tool requires the output file from the scsnvmisc annotate command described below
scsnv snvcounts -t -s sample/pileup_passed_snvs.txt.gz -b sample/passed_barcodes.txt.gz -i index_prefix -o sample/snv -l V2 sample/collapsed.bam

```

Note:

The pileup command will also work with the Cell Ranger BAM file or STAR Solo BAM file. It requires the -c flag to be set and a passed_barcodes.txt.gz file with the following format:

```
barcode
GCAATCAGTACTTGAC
AAATGCCGTCGCCATG
...
etc
```
The barcodes should not contain a -1 in them.  For the bam files these will automatically be removed from the CB tag. The annotate command will work on the output from these files.

##### REDIPortal download
The files can be directly downloaded from the REDIPortal database
Note that the chromosome names may need to be remapped depending on the reference build you used for mapping and alignment.
Chromosome mapping files can be found [here](https://github.com/dpryan79/ChromosomeMappings). The first column would need to be remapped to the correct chromosome names if they do not match

##### RepeatMasker download
The files can be directly downloaded from the UCSC Table Browser `rmsk` table
Note that the chromosome names may need to be remapped depending on the reference build you used for mapping and alignment.
Chromosome mapping files can be found [here](https://github.com/dpryan79/ChromosomeMappings). The fifth column would need to be remapped to the correct chromosome names if they do not match

##### 1000 Genomes File Generation:
```bash
wget ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-99/variation/vcf/homo_sapiens/1000GENOMES-phase_3.vcf.gz

#### Annotated HDF5 to market matrix format
##### Command:
```bash
#You can use scsnvmisc snv2vcfmtx -h to view the command line options
scsnvmisc snv2vcfmtx -r scsnv_index/gwsc_lenghts.txt -f genome.fa -o <output directory> --max-af 1 -c pileup_annotated.h5
```
##### Output Files:

| File        | Contents      |
| ---------------|:--------------|
| refs.mtx | Reference base counts for each barcode/SNV |
| alts.mtx | Alternative base counts for each barcode/SNV |
| snvs.csv | Annotated SNV information |
| snvs.vcf | Basic SNV vcf |


#### Merge -- Merge the annotated output from multiple alignment tools to calculate accuracy using a matched whole genome or exome sequence
##### Command:
```bash
scsnvmisc merge -n scsnv -n cellranger --vcf <snvs>.vcf -o sample/merged scsnv/pileup cellranger/pileup
```

A -n argument is required for each alignment method. This will generate a merged SNV file that can be used to calculate strand specific reference and alternative alelle counts for each of the SNVs.  This will remove sites that are not biallelic.

#### accuracy -- Calculate barcode counts and coverage information for the SNVs in the file outputted by the merge command
##### Command:
```bash
scsnv accuracy -n genome -a G -b sample/passed_barcodes.txt.gz -r genome_fasta.fa -i index_prefix -o sample/accuracy_genome.txt.gz -s sample/merged.txt.gz -l V2 WGS.bam
scsnv accuracy -n scsnv -a S -b sample/passed_barcodes.txt.gz -r genome_fasta.fa -i index_prefix -o sample/accuracy_scsnv.txt.gz -s sample/merged.txt.gz -l V2 collapsed.bam

scsnv accuracy -n scsnv_merged -a D -b sample/passed_barcodes.txt.gz -r genome_fasta.fa -i index_prefix -o sample/accuracy_scsnv_merged.txt.gz -s sample/merged.txt.gz -l V2 merged.bam

scsnv accuracy -n cellranger -a C -b sample/passed_barcodes.txt.gz -r genome_fasta -i index_prefix -o sample/accuracy_cellranger.txt.gz -s sample/merged.txt.gz -l V2 cellranger/outs/possorted_genome_bam.bam
```
These commands will also generate SNV x cell count matrices similar to the pileup command.

#### results -- Merge the results from multiple scsnv accuracy runs

scsnvmisc results -o results.txt.gz sample/accuracy

The output file will contain merged counts from all of the files as well as some useful annotations from the merged_snvs.txt.gz file that was generated from the merge command. This command will read all files with the prefix ```sample/accuracy_*.txt.gz``` and merge them together

This will output a file with all of the SNV counts from all of the tools.  


#### TODO: 

1) Add support for emptydrops
2) Improve the performance of scSNV pileup
